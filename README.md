# RShiny_CoV2
Develop the RShiny Web Database for scCITESeq in Aging for SARS-CoV-2.

This is user friendly website works for the user with no coding experience 

The website divided into 4 different tabs:

1. **Visualization Tab** It includes the UMAP, Violin. splitted UMAP for vaccine and samples

2. **GEX Differential Tab** Within the tab it include the tabItem which divide the tab further into performing differential between 
   a. Clusters
   b. Samples
   c. Vaccine
   d. Samples within Clusters
   e. Vaccine within Clusters
3. **Protein (ADT) Differential Tab** Within the tab it include the tabItem which divide the tab further into performing differential between 
   a. Clusters
   b. Samples
   c. Vaccine
   d. Samples within Clusters
   e. Vaccine within Clusters

GEX and ADT Differential Tab is very similar
