# RShiny_CoV2
Develop the RShiny Web Database for scCITESeq in Aging for SARS-CoV-2.

This is user friendly website works for the user with no coding experience 

The website divided into 4 different tabs:

1. **Visualization Tab** It includes the UMAP, Violin. splitted UMAP for vaccine and samples
